        <p className='py-8'>Technically part of Tokyo, the Izu Islands, including Miyakejima are worlds apart from the Tokyo we know. Miyakejima is home to Mt Oyama, an active volcano which last erupted in the summer of 2000. Whilst it's currently safe to visit, hiking around the area, you'll see the rugged landscape of the remains of the volcanic rock.</p>
